A comparison of Arrays, Linked Lists, and Binary Search Trees (BST), followed by the implementation of a simple program that solves a real-world problem: managing and searching a collection of books.

Each implementation will:

Accept user input to add books.
Search for a book by title.
We'll then analyze and display the Big O time complexity for operations like insertion and search.

Real-World Problem: Managing a Collection of Books
Each implementation stores a list of books where users can:

Add a book by title.
Search for a book by title.


For small datasets, arrays and linked lists may suffice. For larger datasets requiring efficient search and insertion, a BST is recommended.
